On April 10th, 2025, the FOSS Club hosted "‡¥í‡¥∞‡µÅ OpenSource ‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥ï‡¥•" ‚Äì an informal gathering that blended the warmth of a tea party with the excitement of open-source technology and friendly competition.  It was a resounding success, filled with engaging discussions, exciting games, and a whole lot of camaraderie!

The event kicked off with Fahad providing a fantastic introduction to the FOSS Club itself, along with a sneak peek into the fascinating worlds of Google Arcade and Hack Club.  Arul then expertly guided us through the ins and outs of Google Arcade, answering our burning questions as we sipped on steaming cups of tea.  The perfect blend of information and relaxation!

Following the informative session, we transitioned into a lively round of Skribbl io, unleashing our inner artists (or at least, attempting to!). The friendly competition and laughter were infectious, a great way to break the ice and foster a sense of community.

Next up, Fahad from CSE (yes, we had two Fahads ‚Äì one from CSE and one from EC ‚Äì making it a truly collaborative effort!) delivered an insightful presentation on Hack Club, highlighting its incredible opportunities for teenagers. He encouraged attendees to spread the word to their younger siblings and cousins, emphasizing the potential for growth and learning within the community.

Finally, we tested our knowledge of FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) with a challenging crossword puzzle featuring FOSS-related terms.  While Shadin and Hameetha expertly solved the puzzle,  (they're *too* good, so we just ignored them üòπ), we crowned Stefi and Niya as our winners ‚Äì a well-deserved victory!

A huge thank you goes out to Bhadra, Aysha Henan, Hameetha, and both Fahads (CSE & EC) for their tireless efforts in making this event such a memorable one.  Your dedication and hard work truly brought the "‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥ï‡¥•" to life!

"‡¥í‡¥∞‡µÅ OpenSource ‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡¥ï‡¥•" was more than just an event; it was a celebration of open-source, a testament to the power of community, and a delightful afternoon filled with learning and laughter. We look forward to many more such gatherings in the future!
